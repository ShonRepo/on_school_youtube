# OnSchoolYoutube

This project relates to series of screencasts [Online School on Ruby on Rails](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnWL52t-cS1wckODkh7WE0npUGUhbQmID) on the youtube channel by [Aleksey Evdokimov](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fL5sSP1-r5W8uuxmFmhHQ)

User web interface was removed due to licensing restrictions, but all the logic and admin web interface remained unchanged.

The project in the form in which it is in the repository is no longer developed and is not supported and has an exclusively educational purpose.
